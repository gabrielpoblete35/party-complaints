    <h1>Noise complaints in one Bronx area have skyrocketed
    </h1>

    <p>
      MIAMI – Party and loud music complaints have drastically increased this year,
      amid the pandemic. One area in the Bronx is topping the list.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bronx Community Board 12 has seen nearly 58,000 311 party/loud music
      complaints from June through October,
      <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/erm2-nwe9/visualizationaccording">
        According to the city's open data website,</a>
      more than any other community board. During that same time last year,
      it only 2,333 party/loud music complaints.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bronx Community Board 12, which includes Williamsbridge, Wakefield and
      Edenwald, consists of more single-family homes than most other areas in
      the city. Police say that it makes it ripe for pop-up parties. Erik
      Hernandez, the executive officer of the Detective Borough Bronx, said the
      47th Precinct has observed an increase in pop-up parties, with people
      charging for cover and alcohol.

      “It is a legitimate, legitimate issue where many private homes,
      whether it’s the summer or the winter, are turned into unauthorized
      social clubs,” he said.
